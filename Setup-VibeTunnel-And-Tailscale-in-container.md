Based on the GitHub repository, VibeTunnel is a macOS native app written in Swift/SwiftUI with a high-performance Rust server for terminal management
GitHub - amantus-ai/vibetunnel: Turn any browser into your terminal & command your agents on the go.
. It's specifically designed for Mac and requires macOS to run.

No, VibeTunnel cannot run from inside a Docker container because:

Native macOS dependency - It's a native macOS app written in Swift/SwiftUI
GitHub - amantus-ai/vibetunnel: Turn any browser into your terminal & command your agents on the go.
System integration - It needs to access your Mac's terminal sessions and menu bar
Architecture - Uses a Rust server component that manages terminal sessions on macOS
GitHub - amantus-ai/vibetunnel: Turn any browser into your terminal & command your agents on the go.
Docker containers share the host kernel, so you'd need macOS as the host system anyway. Even then, the app is designed to run natively on macOS, not in a containerized environment.

If you need terminal access from containers, consider alternatives like SSH tunneling or web-based terminal solutions designed for containerized environments.

npm Package (Linux & Headless Systems)

For Linux servers, Docker containers, or headless macOS systems, install via npm:

npm install -g vibetunnel

Edit
You're absolutely right! I missed that important detail.

Yes, VibeTunnel can run from inside a Docker container using the npm package:

bash
npm install -g vibetunnel
This npm version is specifically designed for:

Linux servers
Docker containers
Headless macOS systems
The npm package provides the core functionality without the native macOS GUI, making it perfect for containerized environments where you need terminal tunneling capabilities.

So to answer your original question: Yes, you can run VibeTunnel inside a Docker container using the npm package version.

What about tailscale how would you have that in a docker image?

For Tailscale in Docker, you have several approaches:

Official Tailscale Docker Image
Tailscale has an official Docker image available in Docker Hub and GitHub Packages
Using Tailscale with Docker · Tailscale Docs
:

javascript
// Basic docker-compose.yml with VibeTunnel + Tailscale
version: '3.8'
services:
tailscale:
image: tailscale/tailscale:latest
container_name: vibetunnel-tailscale
hostname: vibetunnel-server
environment: - TS_AUTHKEY=${TS_AUTHKEY} - TS_STATE_DIR=/var/lib/tailscale - TS_USERSPACE=false
volumes: - tailscale-state:/var/lib/tailscale - /dev/net/tun:/dev/net/tun
cap_add: - NET_ADMIN - SYS_MODULE
restart: unless-stopped

vibetunnel:
image: node:18-alpine
container_name: vibetunnel
network_mode: service:tailscale
working_dir: /app
command: sh -c "npm install -g vibetunnel && vibetunnel"
restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
tailscale-state:
driver: local
Key Configuration Points
Environment Variables:

TS_AUTHKEY - auth key for authentication
Using Tailscale with Docker · Tailscale Docs
TS_STATE_DIR - directory where Tailscale state is stored, needs to persist across restarts
Using Tailscale with Docker · Tailscale Docs
Volumes:

Mount /var/lib/tailscale to persist state across container restarts
Using Tailscale with Docker · Tailscale Docs
Mount /dev/net/tun for kernel networking
Capabilities:

Add NET_ADMIN and SYS_MODULE capabilities
Using Tailscale with Docker · Tailscale Docs
Networking:

Use network_mode: service:tailscale to route all traffic through the Tailscale container (sidecar pattern)

Get your auth key from the Tailscale admin console under Settings > Keys.

So docker compose runs 2 images together?

Edit
Yes, exactly! Docker Compose can run multiple containers together as a single application stack
Add a Docker container · Tailscale Docs
.

In the example I showed:

javascript
// Two separate containers working together
services:
tailscale: // Container 1: Tailscale networking
image: tailscale/tailscale:latest

vibetunnel: // Container 2: VibeTunnel app
image: node:18-alpine
network_mode: service:tailscale // Routes through container 1
How it works:

tailscale container handles the VPN connection
vibetunnel container runs the actual app
network_mode: service:tailscale routes all VibeTunnel traffic through the Tailscale container - this is called a "sidecar" pattern
Contain your excitement: A deep dive into using Tailscale with Docker
Benefits:

Separation of concerns (networking vs app logic)
Can reuse the Tailscale container for other services
Easy to manage both together with one command: docker compose up
This is common for microservices - one container per service, all coordinated by Docker Compose.

How do you set TS_AUTHKEY?

Edit
You can set TS_AUTHKEY in several ways:

1. Environment File (.env)
   Create a .env file in your docker-compose directory:

javascript
// .env file
TS_AUTHKEY=tskey-auth-kJDnLXE8sT11CNTRL-example123456789
Then reference it in docker-compose:

javascript
environment:

- TS_AUTHKEY=${TS_AUTHKEY}

2. Direct in docker-compose.yml
   javascript
   environment:

- TS_AUTHKEY=tskey-auth-kJDnLXE8sT11CNTRL-example123456

3. Shell Environment Variable
   bash
   export TS_AUTHKEY=tskey-auth-kJDnLXE8sT11CNTRL-example123456
   docker compose up
   Getting the Auth Key
   To get your auth key, open the Keys page of the admin console, select Generate auth key, provide a key name, toggle Reusable to on, and select Generate key
   Add a Docker container · Tailscale Docs
   .

Recommended: Use the .env file approach - keeps secrets out of your compose file and git history. Add .env to your .gitignore.

Does docker compose work with dev containers?

Yes! Dev containers work seamlessly with Docker Compose
Connect to multiple containers
. You can reference Docker Compose files in your dev container configuration.

How it works:
In your .devcontainer/devcontainer.json:

javascript
{
"name": "VibeTunnel Dev Container",
"dockerComposeFile": ["../docker-compose.yml"],
"service": "vibetunnel",
"workspaceFolder": "/workspace"
}
Your docker-compose.yml:

javascript
// docker-compose.yml  
version: '3.8'
services:
tailscale:
image: tailscale/tailscale:latest
environment: - TS_AUTHKEY=${TS_AUTHKEY}
volumes: - /dev/net/tun:/dev/net/tun
cap_add: - NET_ADMIN

vibetunnel:
image: node:18-alpine
network_mode: service:tailscale
volumes: - ..:/workspace // Mount your project code
command: sleep infinity // Keep container running
Benefits:

When you open in dev container, VS Code connects to the vibetunnel service while Tailscale runs in its own container.
